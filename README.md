# Simon Says (ala Arduino)

First project to learn how to use an Arduino more specifically Adafruit's Circuit Playground.  I decide to recreate the electronic version 
of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game)" target="_blank">Simon Says</a>, a game that challenges the player to repeat a 
sequence of lights and tones.  My version consist of four "stages": start, game, win and lose.

On the start stage, press either of the two buttons to begin the game.

During the game stage, use the capative touch pads closes to the sequence played to continue through the game.

You lose if you fail to repeat the sequence in the correct order.  You win if you successfully repeat a sequence of length seven.

There is also the option to turn off of the sound using the slide button.

Enjoy!
